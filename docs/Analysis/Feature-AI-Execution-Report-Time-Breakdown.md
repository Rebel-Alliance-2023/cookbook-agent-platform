# One Engineer + AI Execution Report Time Breakdown

This report summarizes **recorded task/session durations** from the execution reports. Because the reports were created using **mixed tracking methods**, the breakdown is presented at the **best available granularity per report**:

- **Session-level (manual):** Milestone 1 (sessions with total minutes).

- **Batch-level only:** Milestone 2 (single recorded batch duration).

- **Task-level (automated):** Milestones 4 and CC.

- **Hybrid:** Milestones 3 and 5 (session totals + some task-level timings; several tasks are marked bundled/included).

## Appendix: Salary Cost Calculations (Single Engineer @ **$150,000/year**) — Based on Recorded Execution Time

### A. Per-engineer salary cost

* **Annual:** $150,000
* **Monthly (annual / 12):** $150,000 / 12 = **$12,500**
* **Workday rate (assuming 260 workdays/year):** $150,000 / 260 = **$576.923/day**

### B. Team salary cost (1 engineer)

* **Annual:** **$150,000**
* **Monthly:** **$12,500**
* **Workday rate:** **$576.923/day**

### C. Total cost to execute the work (from recorded execution time)

Using **session totals** per report:

* Milestone 1 total: **3h 25m** 
* Milestone 2 total: **11m** 
* Milestone 3 total (all session occurrences): **31m** 
* Milestone 4 total: **1h 1m** 
* Milestone 5 total (sessions): **56m** 
* Milestone CC total (sessions): **33m** 

**Total recorded execution time:** 3h25m + 11m + 31m + 1h1m + 56m + 33m = **397 minutes = 6h 37m**

Convert to engineer-days (8h/day):

* 6h 37m = 6.6167 hours
* Engineer-days = 6.6167 / 8 = **0.8271 days**

**Cost = 0.8271 days × $576.923/day = $477.16**

### D. Total cost to do the work (final)

**Estimated salary cost to execute the recorded work: *$477.16*.**
