Best Ever Homemade Pasta

Making fresh pasta at home is easier than you think! This simple recipe uses just a few basic ingredients to create silky, delicious pasta that's perfect with any sauce.

Preparation: 20 minutes (plus 30 minutes resting)
Cooking time: 3-4 minutes
Makes: 4 servings

What You'll Need:

2 cups tipo 00 flour (or all-purpose flour)
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

How to Make It:

Mound the flour on a clean work surface and create a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well, add olive oil and salt.

Using a fork, gradually whisk the eggs while slowly incorporating flour from the inner walls of the well. Continue until a shaggy dough forms.

Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. It should feel like playdough. If too sticky, add a little flour; if too dry, wet your hands slightly.

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. This relaxes the gluten and makes rolling easier.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with one piece at a time (keep others covered), roll through a pasta machine, starting at the widest setting and progressively going thinner. Or use a rolling pin to roll very thin.

Cut into desired shapes – fettuccine, tagliatelle, or leave as sheets for lasagna.

To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Cook fresh pasta for only 3-4 minutes – it cooks much faster than dried pasta!

Toss immediately with your favorite sauce and serve right away.

Notes: Fresh pasta should be used same day or dried for storage. You can freeze for up to 3 months.
