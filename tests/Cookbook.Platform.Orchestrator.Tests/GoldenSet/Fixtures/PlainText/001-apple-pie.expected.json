  "instructions": [
    "Make the crust by combining flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in cold butter using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.",
    "Sprinkle ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork until dough comes together. Divide in half, form into disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",
    "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).",
    "For the filling, combine sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Toss until apples are evenly coated.",
    "Roll out one disk of dough on a floured surface to about 12 inches. Transfer to a 9-inch pie dish, pressing gently into the bottom and sides.",
    "Add apple filling, mounding slightly in the center. Dot with butter pieces.",
    "Roll out second disk of dough and place over filling. Trim edges, then crimp to seal. Cut several slits in the top crust for steam to escape.",
    "Brush top with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar.",
    "Bake for 45-50 minutes until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling. If edges brown too quickly, cover with foil.",
    "Cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing to allow filling to set."
