INSTRUCTIONS

MARINATE THE CHICKEN: Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.

COOK THE CHICKEN: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add marinated chicken in batches and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-6 minutes. Chicken doesn't need to be fully cooked through yet. Set aside.

MAKE THE SAUCE: In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

ADD TOMATOES AND SPICES: Pour in crushed tomatoes, garam masala, paprika, and cayenne. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens.

FINISH THE DISH: Reduce heat to low. Stir in heavy cream and honey. Add cooked chicken pieces and simmer for another 10-15 minutes until chicken is cooked through and sauce is creamy.

SERVE: Taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot over basmati rice or with warm naan bread.

CHEF'S NOTES:
• For a lighter version, use coconut milk instead of heavy cream
• Make it spicier by adding more cayenne or some fresh chilies
• Leftovers keep well in the fridge for 3-4 days
